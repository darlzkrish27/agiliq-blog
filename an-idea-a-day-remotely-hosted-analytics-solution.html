<h3>Title:</h3>
<p>Remotely hosted Analytics solution.</p>
<h3>The problem:</h3>
<p>For most commercial websites tracking results, about their visitors, about the sites which link to them, about which users convert to sales/leads is a big problem. Google Analytics is the default solution for doing this. In truth Google Analytics is an absolutely marvelous piece of software. Yet there are a few problems with this.</p>
<p>For most webmasters, giving information to Google about their sites is a issue. If you install Google Analytics on your site, what you know about your site, Google know too. Your best performing Adwords keywords, conversion ration and most anything. This is a situation in which many webmasters would not like to be in, but as Google Analytics as the best analytics software, most webmasters choose this.</p>
<h3>The solution:</h3>
<p>Create a remotely hosted analytics software. Do not think much, just STEAL all the features from analytics. If you want to go beyond Analytics, you may try providing services provided by <a href="http://crazyegg.com/">Crazyegg</a>, but I think that would be a case of <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/featuritis_vs_t.html">featuritis</a>. Provide ironclad guarantees in your SLA, that this data will never be provided to any third party.</p>
<h3>Technologies involved:</h3>
<p>A server side technology to collect and make meaning of data. Javascript code to capture the visitors information.</p>
<h3>Existing Competition:</h3>
<p>There are a lot of people who are trying to do this. <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a> and <a href="http://getclicky.com">Clicky</a> are doing this. Of them Mint is a self hosted solution which means that the users need to install on their server, which is hassle many people do not want to get through. Clicky is a remotely hosted software but this is not comparable to the level of detail provided by Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>Market Size:</h3>
<p>Google bought Urchin in 2005. The exact terms of Google's Analytics purchase were not disclosed, but were expected to be in <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/001729.html">ballpark of 30 Millions</a>.</p>
<h3>Others:</h3>
<p>The big issue here is gaining webmasters trust, that you would never share their data with any third party.</p>
