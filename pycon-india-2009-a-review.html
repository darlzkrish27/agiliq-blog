<p><img class="alignright" title="Keynote" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3957867912_c9c8263868_d.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>There have been so many python/django conferences recently, I have been tracking them literally all through the year. Another one, <a href="http://scipy.in/">SciPy India</a> just got announced. Week long, with sprints!</p>
<p>Pycon India was attended by around 350 people and had 30 talks. I have attended many conferences, but this one was different. This one was where real people, the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html">real developers gave talks</a> and socialized. No enterprise BS, just the real thing*.</p>
<p>There were a vast majority of <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/displayschedule/">good talks</a>. However, I could only attend a few. <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/43/">Strand use of Python</a> involved explaining how they journeyed from having a little Jython code to hook up stuff to where they have a significantly large Jython code base, was quite interesting.</p>
<p>There was a talk on <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/32/">Idiomatic P<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2424/3958951548_ff296cab46_d.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Feedback" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2424/3958951548_ff296cab46_d.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>ython</a> from some one who did python at home, altho' the only thing his university expected is "C that runs on Turbo C (which is not really a language)".</p>
<p>There was a talk on <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/30/">design patterns</a> that explained various design patters: Singleton, Iterator, Factory Method, Strategy, observer, decorator. Creating a singleton using decorators is a nice little thing I got out of this talk.</p>
<p>The talks on using Build out for deployment and various testing frameworks of Python, and the keynote byÂ  <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/delegatefull/301/">Prabhu Ramachandran</a>, are some other talks I would have liked to attend. A long session on <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/15/">Introduction to Python</a> by a few experts, helped a lot of the begginers. I, along with 2 fellow Hyderabad django developers, presented a <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/60/">talk on Django</a>.</p>
<p>The event was well organised in many ways. It could have been better in some areas tho'. Connectivity and electrical points to charge laptops were short of the need. Surely, a real time twitter stream from the event could benefit a lot.</p>
<p>While infrastructure can be improved for the next event, surely it is a superb start in the right direction. There are quite a few companies, that work on Python in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_of_India">Indian valley</a>, this event is likely going to be big pretty soon.</p>
<p>*PS: This should perhaps come as a nudge to Joel and Jeff to conduct <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html">Stackoverflow dev days</a> in India too; after all, here is where stackoverflow gets the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/where-in-the-world-do-stack-overflow-users-come-from">third highest traffic</a> from.</p>

or, as <a href="http://holtsblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/dhh-keynote-surplus-go-dubai-and.html">DHH says</a>,
<blockquote>The most depressing thing I can hear is... "it's just a job". How depressing is that? You spend 8, 10, 12 hours per day there. and it's "just a job"?</blockquote></p>
