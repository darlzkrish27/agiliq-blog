mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It started off as Phonegap,
a project of Nitobi Software before it was acquired by Adobe Systems. The code
for the platform was donated to the Apache Software foundation and is currently
being incubated as &quot;Apache Cordova&quot;.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a> is now a distribution of Apache Cordova (analogous to Ubuntu being a
Linux distribution) brought to you by Adobe. Since Apache Cordova is licensed
under the permissive Apache Software License, Adobe Phonegap may technically
be integrated with proprietary software (though there's no evidence for the
same yet).</p>
<p>This post is not going to discuss how to build a cross-platform mobile app using
Phonegap and if you are here expecting that, you are better off checking their
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html">docs</a>. In this post, we are going to see how Phonegap apps work ie how the
javascript component is able to communicate with the native APIs and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The Cordova guys have taken a lot of pain keep a consistent JS interface on the
client side but underneath there is a large divergence between each platform.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss the architectures of android and iOS since these are
the most widely used platforms and restrict ourselves to version 2.0 of Cordova.</p>
<p>Every phonegap app has the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A chrome-less browser. On iOS and Android, it is WebKit (UIWebView on iOS and
WebView on android to be specific).</li>
<li>JS to Native bridge to allow for communication between the HTML application
and the native platform.</li>
<li>A native to JS bridge to allow the native platform to talk to the HTML
application.</li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://agiliq.com/dumps/images/20120906/android_phonegap.png"><img alt="Android Phonegap architecture" class="align-center" src="http://agiliq.com/dumps/images/20120906/android_phonegap.png" style="width: 470px; height: 332px;" /></a>
<p>In android, by default the JS to Native Bridge is set to <cite>Prompt</cite> (yes, you saw
it right, the venerable JS prompt dialog box). The JS functions (like camera,
contacts etc) are converted to Prompt commands by the cordova javascript and
intercepted by the WebView <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebChromeClient.html#onJsPrompt(android.webkit.WebView,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,android.webkit.JsPromptResult)">onJsPrompt</a> and based on a specific signature calls
the respective native plugin (camera, contacts etc).</p>
<p>It is also possible to change the JS to Native bridge and another way of
communication is through the <cite>JS_Object</cite> bridge. When the WebView is loaded and
the JS bridge is set, the WebView adds a <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#addJavascriptInterface(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)">Javascript Interface</a> which calls a
Java object (calling the respective native plugin based on the arguments of the
interface).</p>
<p>There is yet another JS to Native bridge (currently experimental) which calls
the native plugins by triggering changes in the location URL.</p>
<p>Now we come to the other end of the communication ie the Native to JS bridge.
By default, the bridge is set to <cite>polling</cite> and the javascript keeps polling the
native side for a response every 50 milliseconds. This is very suboptimal but
the solution works on the largest number of devices and in most setups.</p>
<p>Just like the JS to Native bridge, the Native to JS bridge can also be changed.
Another Native to JS bridge is the XHR bridge (called the <cite>HANGING_GET</cite> internally
as a reference to a long lived XHR connection). This bridge runs a callback server
locally and responds to the XHR requests.</p>
<p>There is yet another bridge that uses Java internal reflection on the webview to
call the methods but is available only on Android 3.2+. There are a couple of other
bridges but don't seem to be in use at this point in time.</p>
<p>Now let's look at how the iOS phonegap apps work.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://agiliq.com/dumps/images/20120906/ios_phonegap.png"><img alt="iOS Phonegap architecture" class="align-center" src="http://agiliq.com/dumps/images/20120906/ios_phonegap.png" style="width: 470px; height: 332px;" /></a>
<p>Compared to Android, iOS has fewer bridges. On iOS 4.2 and below, the JS and Native
bridge communicate with each other through an iframe. The JS calls are stored in a
JS queue which is read and executed by the native component.</p>
<p>The other bridge is an XHR bridge which makes calls to a fake URL with the commands
in the header. These commands are intercepted, serialized and then executed.</p>
<p>For the Native to JS bridge, the iOS phonegap apps have only one bridge and all the
communication happens through a UIWebView method called <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know how Phonegap apps work, we can write better apps and
plugins and guess where we can improve our application's performance.</p>
