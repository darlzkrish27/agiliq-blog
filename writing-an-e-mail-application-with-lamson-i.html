            <p>Off late, we've been slightly busy with a 'lot' of new developments on our
end and we've not been able to devote attention to the blog. In these busy
periods, we tend to forget things faster. One such thing that Shabda recently
pointed out that a couple of our applications (client and open source project)
were raising exception. Because of the low frequency of these errors, they went unnoticed
for quite a few days. We do check e-mail often but we are mostly drowned in
our project management tool, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfuddle.com/">Unfuddle</a>. Shabda suggested we open a ticket for
every error (with duplicates taken care off) and this way we wouldn't have to
distract ourselves scouring multiple sources like mail, Unfuddle etc.</p>
<p>This was a fairly straightforward requirement. Unfuddle has an API and all we
have to do is wrap the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/views/#the-500-server-error-view">500 error handler</a>. We could write the error handler
in a separate app and then add it to the <tt class="docutils literal">INSTALLED_APPS</tt> setting and error handler
to all the projects. Sounds fine but we should not miss out a single project! It didn't
sound like a scalable solution and so we decided to add an e-mail address to the
<tt class="docutils literal">MAIL_ADMINS</tt> setting that would open a ticket invoking the Unfuddle API. Not a
big difference over the previous solution. This method just saves 1 line of typing
over the previous. But the idea of having to learn and use <a class="reference external" href="http://lamsonproject.org/">Lamson</a> got us excited!</p>
<p>Lamson is a Python SMTP server written by <a class="reference external" href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> that makes e-mail application development not suck!
If we hadn't heard of Lamson, we would've probably used Postfix to drop mail to
fetchmail and then run a python script to parse the mail and redirect it accordingly.
This solution has way too many dependencies and is a configuration hell!</p>
<p>In the coming blog posts, let's write a Lamson powered e-mail app that will open a
ticket in the unfuddle project management system through their API. Before we start,
I will give away a little secret. You don't have to be a sys-admin or a python expert
to write an e-mail app powered by Lamson. It's as easy as writing a simple web app
in django.</p>
<div class="section" id="installation-of-lamson">
<h2>Installation of Lamson</h2>
<p>The Lamson documentation covers how to <a class="reference external" href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/getting_started.html">install</a> Lamson. But we are not going to discuss
this very deeply. We'll just use a <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> to install it.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ virtualenv lamson_env
$ cd lamson_env
$ source bin/activate
$ pip install lamson
</pre>
<p>Now let's create a lamson app named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ticket-creator</span></tt> that will house the e-mail application.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ lamson gen -project ticket-creator
$ cd ticket-creator
$ ls ticket-creator
app  config  logs  muttrc  README  run  tests
</pre>
<p>Lamson creates files for us to make code organization very easy. Let us next look at the
functionality of the files:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ls app/
data  handlers  __init__.py  model  templates
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">app</tt> directory holds all the logic for the e-mail application. Right from the models (models),
the views (templates) and controllers (handlers), it houses them all! Doesn't this method of
organizing the code look similar? Yes, it is an MVC based e-mail app framework!:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ls config
boot.py  __init__.py  logging.conf  settings.py  testing.py  test_logging.conf
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">boot.py</tt> contains the config attributes that is loaded when lamson starts. Most likely, you
wouldn't have to touch this file. The <tt class="docutils literal">settings.py</tt> holds all the configuration attributes. This
file is analogous to the django settings and is just a plain python file. The <tt class="docutils literal">testing.py</tt>
is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal">boot.py</tt> but is used in test mode. The <tt class="docutils literal">logging.conf</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">test_logging.conf</tt>
hold all the logging related attributes.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">logs</tt> directory holds the files where the logging outputs are redirected. To debug your
server, this is <cite>the</cite> place you've to start off. The <tt class="docutils literal">muttrc</tt> file holds the mutt configuration
directives to use lamson to send mail and open a local mailbox. The <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt> directory holds the pid
and other runtime specific files. The <tt class="docutils literal">tests</tt> directory houses all the test cases you might write
while developing your e-mail application.</p>
<p>For this session, let's close with starting the lamson server. In the e-mail app:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ lamson start
$ ls run
smtp.pid undeliverable
$ ps aux|grep lamson
theju 10155 0.2 0.1 21768 7532 ? Sl 19:19 0:00 /home/theju/lamson_env/bin/python /home/theju/lamson_env/bin/lamson start
</pre>
<p>To see on which port lamson is running, or to modify the port, we can change the port of the <tt class="docutils literal">receiver_config</tt>
attribute in the <tt class="docutils literal">config/settings.py</tt> file. To stop lamson, just type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ lamson stop
Stopping processes with the following PID files: ['./run/smtp.pid']
Attempting to stop lamson at pid 10155
</pre>
<p>This is the end of the first part where we just dipped our finger nails into this amazing project
called <tt class="docutils literal">Lamson</tt>. In the coming post, we are going to see how to write the logic for the application
and in the final post on how to deploy this application.</p>
