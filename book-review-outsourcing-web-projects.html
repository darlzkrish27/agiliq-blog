            <p><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a> had a <a href="http://sale.sitepoint.com/">book sales</a> running recently where they made all their books
available for sale at 7$. Being a sucker for good books and deals, I bought more
than I should have. Here is the review of the first I read, "<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/outsourcing1pdf/">Outsourcing web projects.</a>"</p>
<p>This books is written from the viewpoint of buyers, but as a vendor, I have some
insights (IMO) from the other side.</p>
<p>It starts with these chapters.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Have Vendors Competing for your Job.</li>
<li>How to Find the Perfect Outsourcing Partner.</li>
<li>How to Get the Best Price for your Project.</li>
<li>How to Get it All on Paper.</li>
<li>How to Keep the Project on Track. </li>
<li>How to Turn your Vendor into a Long-term Partner.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Have Vendors Competing for your Job.</h3>
<p>Getting vendors is easy, getting the perfect vendor for you is harder. This chapter
tells you how.</p>
<p>It boils down to</p>
<ul>
<li>Be knowledgeable.</li>
<li>Be willing to give and take.</li>
<li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter is pretty spot on. Nothing turns of a vendor like a client who seems
like he doesn't know the scope of work, or is going to be a pain to be working with.
If you look like one, and get a quote, you are getting a "Painful Customer price".</p>
<h3>How to Find the Perfect Outsourcing Partner.</h3>
<p>This chapter provides step by step guide to pare down the big list of Vendors you must have got in chapter 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate the lowball offers, they probably don't understand the complexity.</li>
<li>Eliminate the too high prices, you probably got the "Painful Customer price".</li>
<li>Eliminate those who do not have references and portfolios for type of work you need.</li>
<li>Eliminate those who can not prove and justify claims in their portfolios.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall another spot on chapter.</p>
<h3>How to Get the Best Price for your Project.</h3>
<p>After chapter 2, you have a small list of vendors who all have expertise. You can get the
best price for you from these vendors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prove again that you are a non painful client.</li>
<li>Use info you have gained from talking to multiple vendors to see if any of the vendors will
sweeten the deal.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Get it All on Paper.</h3>
<p>You have now selected a vendor and need to get the Payment and legal structure. This chapter
explain the legal terms.</p>
<p>It provides guidelines on choosing between fixed and hourly bid. (If your project is complex
go with hourly). For fixed bids, it recommends tying payments to a milestone based structure,
another which I agree with.</p>
<h3>How to Keep the Project on Track.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep realistic expectation, and expectations in sync.</li>
<li>Have communication but not too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter is fairly basic, and if you are the person keeping track of progress, you would
probably know everything this chapter explains, but this good as an overview.</p>
<h3>How to Turn your Vendor into a Long-term Partner.</h3>
<p>Getting new vendors is hard and time consuming, so you want trusted people you have worked with.</p>
<p>Just do what you claimed when choosing the vendor in step 1, and they would be
glad to work with you again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be knowledgeable.</li>
<li>Be willing to give and take.</li>
<li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these,</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay on time</li>
<li>Offer to write testimonials/references.</li>
<li>Send referral customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again a spot on chapter. There are people who we have worked with for years, and who we
give massive discounts to work with them. There are people who I wont want to work with in any price.
This chapter gets the difference completely.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall I think this is a very well written book, and if you are looking to hire a vendor for
a web project this is a must read book. <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/outsourcing1pdf/">Buy it here</a>.</p>
