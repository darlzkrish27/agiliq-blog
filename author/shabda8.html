I assume you already have an idea how Seo works. We will take the example of a hypothetical Blog app to explain the suggestions made. Without further ado, here are the tips. Basic 1. Use beautiful URLs. 2. Learn the difference between HTTP 301 and HTTP 302 redirects. 3. Layout content in a SEO friendly way. 4. Create a sitmaps. Not so obvious 1. Use the Admin to allow end users to update fields. 2. Do not get your Url structures too deep. 3. Create a robots.txt file.</p>
