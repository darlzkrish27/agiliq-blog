</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>For all its technical merits, Django is still a very <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=php%2C+django%2C+">niche technology</a>. It is my belief that the thing which is holding Django back the most, is due to one of its strengths. Making reusable apps is easy and simple in Django. In Django this is the <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/mar/27/reusable-django-apps/">correct</a> way to do things. You take a few apps, mix them together in your project, and deploy to start your site. Compare the installation steps of Wordpress and an imaginary blog software better than Wordpress called Djangopress. #### Wordpress 1. FTP wordpress to webserver. 2. Point browser to site.com/blog 3. Next-Next-Next done.</p>
