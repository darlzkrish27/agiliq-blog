</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Recently I updated a lot of our old apps to be compatible with Django 1.0 and be reusable. Before we go further, let me define a _ Reusable Django App _. A Django app is reusable if * It is app. (That is, it is not a project, and has no settings.py/manage.py.) * It can be dropped in an existing project, and only places where the project should need editing are <code>settings.py</code> <code>installed_apps</code> and the projects level <code>urls.py</code>. * It can be used in the project with an arbitrary url prefix. The updated apps were written initially for Django 0.96</p>

A form which knows how to render itself as Html. 2. A form which knows how to validate data on the server side. 3. A form which knows how to show the relevant errors.

Use beautiful URLs. 2. Learn the difference between HTTP 301 and HTTP 302 redirects. 3. Layout content in a SEO friendly way. 4. Create a sitmaps. Not so obvious 1. Use the Admin to allow end users to update fields. 2. Do not get your Url structures too deep. 3. Create a robots.txt file.</p>
