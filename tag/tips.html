</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a href="http://unfuddle.com/">Unfuddle</a> is the tool we use for our non open source development. 
I have found it to be the best tool for Software Project management, in particular 
I think it is superior to Basecamp and Assembla. </p>
<p>When you start using Unfuddle, the number of things can seem overwhelming. This tutorial should help you <em>Unfuddle the Unfuddle</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Unfuddle Glossary</h2>
<p>Unfuddle has,</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects: Top level Things which need to be done.</li>
<li>User: People who are working on a given project.</li>
<li>Ticket: What a <code>User</code> works on.</li>
<li>Milestone: A timed list of <code>ticket</code>s which should be completed before this given time.</li>
<li>Messages: A broadcast for all <code>user</code>s.</li>
<li>Notebook: A wiki for storing documentation.</li>
<li>Repository: Git or SVN for storing the code.</li>
<li>Ticket Report: Reports about the </li>
</ul>
<h2>The tips</h2>
<h4>Work from a list.</h4>
<p>All action item items should be a ticket for somebody. Everything which a <code>user</code> needs to work should be in his work queue.</p>
<h4>Make it easy to see everyone's work items.</h4>
<p>When we start a project we create project reports with every <code>user</code> ticket queue.</p>
<h4>Manage cognitive overload</h4>
<p>People should have less than 10 tickets in their queue. More than this leads to a paradox of choice, 
with making it hard to decide to work on. 5 is a good number of open tickets per person, with proving choices on what to work on next, 
without being overwhelming.</p>
<h4>Prefer Unfuddle messages to email.</h4>
<p>Unfuddle message threads are easier to refer to in conversation in tickets and other places, having a meaningful url.</p>
<h4>Commit all your code.</h4>
<p>All code should be in a central repo, which can be refered to from tickets and messages.</p>
<h4>Commit messages should be meaningful.</h4>
<p>This is a good commit message.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Makes the color of visited links on Buy now page to Cyan
Anonymous users can do a checkout using Paypal
Refs #441, fixes #372
</pre></div>


<p>This will automatically attach this commit to the given tickets, making it easier to track why a change was introduced, and how did a bug get fixed.</p>
<h4>Get all stakeholders on board.</h4>
<p>Your project probably has many people who are acuustomed to keeping things on email. For them using a tool like Unfuddle would be a big change.
You need to get them on board to use Unfuddle. </p>

<p>This was first in a series of tutorials we would be publishing for using Unfuddle. Stay tuned.</p>

If you must use captcha, here are some best practices working with them. ### Can you do without one? A lot of places captcha's are put to filter spam in user generated comment. One of the largest sources of UGC is comments on wordpress blogs. They do not use a captcha, and instead pass all comments through Akismet to verify which comments are spam, and reject the spams. In many cases, such a system would work for</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Recently I updated a lot of our old apps to be compatible with Django 1.0 and be reusable. Before we go further, let me define a _ Reusable Django App _. A Django app is reusable if * It is app. (That is, it is not a project, and has no settings.py/manage.py.) * It can be dropped in an existing project, and only places where the project should need editing are <code>settings.py</code> <code>installed_apps</code> and the projects level <code>urls.py</code>. * It can be used in the project with an arbitrary url prefix. The updated apps were written initially for Django 0.96</p>

Advantages of subdomain 1. Sometimes looks more professional. Users will prefer someblog.wordpress.com over wordpress.com/someblog. 2. If each part of your site is Under a different untrusted users, you might want to give them a separate subdomain, so that if they do Blackhat Seo on their part, the main site is not harmed. 3.
