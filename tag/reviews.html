</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This is a good book for anyone who's just starting out in web design, especially those with a creative slant than a technical one. It  is all about principles of design, layout ideas, color theory, textures, typography. </p>
<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
<p>Importance of information architecture (IA) is explained, like how to take the requirements before starting the design process and how to start the design process. 
Unfortunately most of the clients do not provide enough information for design process.</p>
<h3>Grid system</h3>
<p>Very well explained about the importance of grid system. I found some interesting things like <strong>“The Rule of Thirds”</strong>, <strong>“960 Grid System”</strong> , <strong>“Symmetrical Balance”</strong> , <strong>“Placement”</strong> , <strong>“Continuance”</strong> ,<strong>“Isolation“</strong>,<strong>“Contrast”</strong>.
Fixed versus Fluid layouts  helps the beginners to understand about  the browsers, screen resolutions etc…</p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>Color tools and resources introduced like <strong>Color Scheme Designer 3</strong>, <strong>Adobe Kuler, COLOURlovers</strong>, <strong>Color Stream iPhone App</strong>, <strong>Pictaculous</strong>  makes the designer’s work easy to create color palettes for their awesome designs. I liked “the psychology of color “ and how it affects the perception that your site will convey to the visitor. Meanings of colours and examples are great.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>Web Font Services, Text Image Replacement, sIFR and Cufón, Text Spacing, Text Alignment, Typeface Distinctions, Serif Fonts, Sans-serif Fonts are worth reading.
<strong>Anatomy of a Letterform</strong> is fantastic.
Several links for free font galleries and commercial font galleries are shared.</p>
<p>Overall this book is worth reading for beginners to understand the principles of beautiful web design.

<p>Also wishing designers an IE free New Year ;)</p>

I went into this book expecting to read actionable and task focussed book on modern JavaScript, and this book does not disappoint on that count. Using 35 tasks which you are <em>going</em> to need in your browser based JS development, this books teaches required JS techniques. However I went into the book expecting a framework agnostic approach. This book however is very heavily focussed on <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Pototype</a>. Initial chapters start as framework agnostic, but they soon turn into Prototype based. [1] [Chapter wise it</p>

My motivation from this book was to use freelancing advice and use that for our (larger) business. This book is <strong>razor</strong> focussed on Freelancing and even more on people who are starting with or considering starting freelancing. If you are in this group I consider this book very well written, and a must read, but if you are part of a larger group, the razor sharp focus makes this not worthwhile. Chapter wise it is: 1.

I went into this book expecting lot of actionable steps I can use for our projects right away, however this book is heavier on theory. Guess I can not complain with the ame name being The <em>Principles</em> of Project Management. In their own words the book has, ### So What Is Project Management Anyway? This chapter forms an introduction to the art and science of project management. Here, we talk about the key phases every project goes through and why project management skills are increasingly</p>

Here is the review of the first I read, "<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/outsourcing1pdf/">Outsourcing web projects.</a>" This books is written from the viewpoint of buyers, but as a vendor, I have some insights (IMO) from the other side. It starts with these chapters. 1. How to Have Vendors Competing for your Job. 2. How to Find the Perfect Outsourcing Partner. 3. How to Get the Best Price for your Project. 4.</p>
